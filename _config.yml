  text: Kanban can help you improve your process to more effectively deliver value – no matter what process you are working with now, or how good you are in doing it. Kanban is just a few basic principles and practices – but the implications of them is hugely powerful, and can change not only your team but in the long run help and improve the entire organisation around you. You will learn how to discover, little by little, how to improve your ways of working to something better than you could imagine, through the volutionary approach to process improvements.

keynote:
- name: Marcus Hammarberg

  bio: 
  - "For 15 years Marcus Hammarberg has been doing agile and lean software development and helping others do it. He has worked in many different settings, from big banks and insurance companies, to start-ups and within retail. At one big insurance company, the first agile team, started by Marcus, eventually spread to a lean initiative across the business. As a consultant Marcus helps individuals, teams, and whole organizations improve their value delivery flow. Marcus is still a keen programmer and continues to practice and teach the concepts that helped him become a good programmer: TDD, Specification by example, functional programming and Node."
  - "Marcus is a keynote speaker and co-author of Kanban In Action, which has been translated into 5 languages across the globe. He has blogged since 2006 at www.marcusoft.net and spend his spare time playing euphonium in the Salvation Army band at Vasakåren, Stockholm."
  - "2014-2015 Marcus moved to Indonesia with his family to work for the Salvation Army. Unexpectedly his previous experience with lean, agile and kanban was soon put to great use there too. This story is retold as it happened in his second book; Salvation: The Bungsu story"

    title: How agile principles saved a hospital - the inside story
    abstract: 
    - The hospital is not making money, it does not have a valid permit and it pays their staff too little... at this point, the roof falls in. Literally! Would you give up? Most would. But we did not. Instead, we used the principles of agile, lean and kanban to make the hospital amazing. 
    - In this keynote, I will tell you how we applied these principles in practice and about the transformations we created. You will also meet 3 women who helped us turn the hospital around and whose lives were transformed in the process.

  talk:
    title: Intent-Based Leadership
    abstract:
    - 'Our old ideas of good leadership is where the leader knows all, tells all and is always in control. In fact, it’s difficult for us to change because those old habits are so hardwired in our brains! Intent-Based Leadership™ offers a way for us to rewire: to give control, trust and learn to be okay with not having all the answers. It''s a way of leading where the leader sets the environment for others to excel and act to the maximum extent of their creativity and intellect; where team members come to the leader describing what they see, what they think, and what they intend to do. The result: the culture of the organization shifts from one of permission and waiting, to intent and action, and people feel more valued and come to better solutions.'
    - Jenni will share the principles of Intent-Based Leadership – what it takes to give control and achieve excellence in your organization. This way of leading is the key to successful Agile implementations in companies of all sizes.

  talk:
    title: Descaling Agile
    abstract:
    - After the agile community solved how to do programming, testing, release and product management, the hot topic for our industry today seems to be scaling. In an ironic twist for a movement started with ‘people over process’, big consultancies today sell scaling models based on everything from tribes to witchcraft, offering to make agile disciplined and safe.
    - Gojko will help you cut through all the mess and separate out signal from noise.
