Her master’s degree in organisational psychology uniquely qualifies her to deal with the human issues that arise when the Agile paradigm collides with traditional organisational structures.

  bio: In the first dot-com boom, Harry helped take an Internet security start up from 3 employees to acquisition by Sun Microsystems. Since leaving software marketing, he’s been helping organisations think about how their objectives relate to their peoples, designing interactions in the resulting projects, and making the best decisions possible about the products that come out of them. He occasionally speaks at conferences, usually about the things he's learned about making developing software less painful and more effective. He's particularly proud of his work on Neontribe's projects for social good like Mind Of My Own, Doc Ready and the Great British Public Toilet Map amongst others.

  bio: Rupert ran away from the theatre to become a web developer at the turn of the century. Since then he’s been making mistakes at Neontribe as fast as he can, learning from a reasonable percentage of them. Recently he’s been using Javascript to help teenagers talk to doctors, Americans to buy airline tickets and everybody to find their way to the loo.
