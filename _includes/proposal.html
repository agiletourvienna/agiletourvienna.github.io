                                studies (the more state-of-the-art and experimental, the merrier â€“ people who dare to
                                try should be on stage). Please bring your customer or customer project with you.

                                offer a session requiring two 45-minute slots.</p>
                            <p>You will also have the opportunity to engage in discussion with other attendees in an

                                    have not asked any questions, you do not have to respond.
