They give us the ability to tackle Awesome Superproblems: problems that get worse through inaction and which can only be solved through collaboration. However, when we make progress on solving Awesome Superproblems, we find new patterns that can be applied to solve similar problems and improve our development practices."

    - "Wenn man hohe Team-Performance als Verbesserungs-Ziel hat, bekommt man hohe Team-Performance. Das klingt ja super! Ist es aber leider nicht. Hohe Team-Leistung führt zu geringer System-Leistung und die Leistung dem Kunden gegenüber nimmt ab. Das ist nicht so gut, denn unterm Strich werden die Gehälter vom Kunden bezahlt und nicht von hoch performanten Teams."
    - "Genau dieser Teamfokus ist auch der Grund, warum viele große agile Initiativen zu keiner Verbesserung der Unternehmensleistung führen. Im besten Fall sieht man bei teamzentrierten Verbesserungsinitiativen keine Verbesserung auf Unternehmensebene, im Normalfall wird die Leistung sogar schlechter. Lokale Optimierung führt zu globaler Suboptimierung! "
    - "In dieser Session zeige ich, warum man versuchen soll, lokale Optimierung zu vermeiden. Ich zeige auch anhand eines Beispiels, wie man die Agilität teamübergreifend in der Organisation etabliert ohne dabei die Teams bei ihrer Arbeit zu stören. Das Schöne bei diesem Ansatz ist, dass er nahtlos am Ist-Zustand der Organisation anknüpft."

    - "Ten years ago, it was common to only release a couple of new versions a year. Today, there are companies delivering hundreds of software deployments per day. This isn't only true in IT, but also e.g. for Tesla-Automobile, which delivers its software updates a few times a week. "
    - "Where does quality happen when we're releasing this often? Is it possible to have proper quality management and is there enough time for testing? How can we reduce what could be weeks of testing to deliver new features to our clients on a daily basis? "
    - "Alex is a long-term enthusiast for this topic. Based on his experiences with various products and companies, he'll share his insights into the mystery of \"faster testing\". The key questions are: "
    - "- When – When do we test?\n
      - What – What should we test?\n
      - Which quality aspects are important?\n
      - How – How do we test? Which techniques are helpful?\n
      - Who –  Who is involved in testing, test automation, etc.?\n
      - How much  –  How much should we test?"
    - "Furthermore, we discuss the financial benefits of Agile Testing and aiming for Continuous Quality. Last but not least we explore if it only exists in fairy tale land or if it is real."

It will be a time lapse version of a voyage I undertook myself at my previous employer, a Vienna-based company that develops business applications for data management for the financial services industry. As part of a team that worked on a product for managing corporate actions data, I spearheaded the introduction of Behaviour Driven Development (BDD). Using BDD, we were able to address weaknesses in the way that requirements were analysed, communicated and verified."
    - "Your voyage with me will take us back to the first steps my team and I took with BDD. Together, we will re-trace the course towards the first specification using examples, and on to the first automated verification of a feature. We will see how the BDD effort achieved critical momentum and started snowballing. We will also analyse several roadblocks that put a ceiling on the effectiveness of BDD, and come up with ways to improve on such situations."
    - "When you attend this session, you will learn how we approached BDD and made it work for us. You will also learn about the problems we had with BDD. The knowledge of both of these topics will give you guidance on how to apply BDD more effectively in your own projects, and on how to avoid some pitfalls."

    - "When we are working on tests exercising large parts of our software system (e.g. in an acceptance test suite), we often have to set up a considerable amount of data to set the stage for the scenario under test. This might include several calls to cumbersome APIs. At first, such code can be hard do get right. When it is working properly, many times the intention of the setup is greatly hidden in a convoluted mess of code. Therefore, such code can pose a major hurdle for the evolution of the project. Although intensive refactoring can provide benefits, there are things demanding even better readability. At this point, techniques, patterns and tools like Specflow can provide advantages."
    - "In this session we will discuss typical problems faced with the setup of test data and means to address those. We will illustrate three cases where non-trivial setup was needed. After understanding the challenges faced we will present and discuss the final solutions. All topics will be supported by code examples from a 10+ year project that has faced all of those issues."

    - "Pressure on Software Development increases: Stakeholders request reduced time-to-market. Today’s deployment cycles are measured in hours and minutes, not in months. Although Agile methodologies support these requests with continuous integration, they still do not incorporate the daily operations of the continuous delivered code. The use of complex cloud-native architectures forces developers and sys-admins to leave their silos."
    - "DevOps is the methodology that addresses these issues, though DevOps is much more about culture and people than about tools and location. But beware of the pitfall of creating a new DevOps silo."
    - "This presentation will show how we are currently building a DevOps culture within Cisco using the “CALMS” methodology. I will talk about success and failure and our ongoing journey to DevOps on the “CALMS” road which has just started..."

    - "Unit Tests und Legacy Code – eigentlich ein nicht lösbarer Widerspruch oder doch nicht? Oder ist es nur eine Ausrede von Entwicklern um keine lästigen Unit Tests implementieren zu müssen? Diese Session versucht eine Antwort auf diese Fragen zu geben und praktische Tipps, wie die zu erwartenden Probleme gelöst werden können. Die Themen umfassen sowohl organisatorische Aspekte als auch technische Fragen und Lösungen. "
    - "Die Einführung einer neuen SW Development Praktik bedeutet eine Veränderung des bestehenden Entwicklungsprozesses. Wie bei jeder Veränderung gibt es unterschiedliche Ausprägungen von Widerstand. Mit organisatorischen Maßnahmen kann dieser reduziert und vorausschauend vermieden werden. Ähnliches gilt für die technische Vorbereitung. Jede neue Hürde wird als Ausrede verwendet. Legacy Code hat Eigenschaften, die die Erstellung von guten Unit Tests erschwert. Welche Code Smells sind typisch und welche Frameworks können diese umgehen. Der Vortrag gibt einen Überblick über die Probleme und wie diese verhindert bzw. gelöst werden können."

    speaker: "David Evans"
    language: en
    abstract: 
    - "The craft of agile testing is maturing, and we have plenty of skilled and gifted testers in the industry, honing their skills, sharing experiences and techniques, and advancing the state of the art. But too many organisations have trouble making the success of individual testers scale up, as the great testing of the few gets diluted by the mediocrity of average testing in the organisation."
    - "For your organisation to succeed with agile testing, you have to understand these things:"
    - "- The goals you are trying to achieve\n
    - The qualities that influence the goals\n
    - The prerequisites for success\n
    - The dependencies and connections between each of the above."
    - "In this talk I will share my “Pillars of Testing” model, as featured in Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory’s book “More Agile Testing”. The model sets out the structures and dependencies that influence how effective our overall test effort can be in the organisation as a whole, and gives a basis for creating a strategy for success."
